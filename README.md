# Drink-Water-Notification-Reminder-in-Python
We all know the role of water in our lives. Without it we can't survive. But drinking water in correct amount is also important as it not helps in protecting our tissues, spinal cord, and joints but also helps in improving digestion  and protects us from being dehydrated. But the main problem is, that nowadays we are so busy with our work that maximum people just sit on laptops and PCs and drinks only 3-4 glass of water in a day which leads to many diseases. So, to avoid it a notification reminder is created using python so that we can take care of our health while performing other activities as well as this reminder will remind you after a certain interval, that you must drink water
